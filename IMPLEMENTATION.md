# Social Battery Manager - Home/Main Page Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive home screen for the Social Battery Manager app with all the required features as specified in the issue requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Energy Battery Display ✅
- **EnergyBatteryView.kt**: Custom view component for displaying energy battery
- **Color-coded battery**: Green (80%+), Yellow (60-79%), Orange (40-59%), Red (<40%)
- **Animated level changes**: Smooth transitions when energy level changes
- **Real-time stats**: Capacity, remaining energy, and estimated time to target

### 2. Activities Management ✅
- **ActivityAdapter.kt**: RecyclerView adapter for displaying activities list
- **AddActivityDialog.kt**: Dialog for adding/editing activities
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete activities
- **Activity Types**: Work, Social, Exercise, Hobby, Rest, Other
- **Energy Impact**: Activities can increase or decrease energy (-5 to +5)
- **Mood Tracking**: Each activity can have an associated mood

### 3. Mood Picker ✅
- **Chip-based selection**: Easy mood selection with emoji chips
- **Mood Options**: Happy, Neutral, Sad, Tired, Stressed, Energetic
- **Mood logging**: Mood changes are logged in the energy log

### 4. Stats Display ✅
- **Weekly statistics**: Shows energy gain/loss and activity count for the week
- **Real-time updates**: Stats update automatically when activities are added/removed
- **Energy tracking**: Tracks all energy changes over time

### 5. Database Integration ✅
- **Room Database**: Local storage using Room persistence library
- **EnergyLog.kt**: Model for tracking energy changes over time
- **Activity.kt**: Model for activity data
- **Enhanced DAOs**: Full CRUD operations for activities and energy logs
- **Database versioning**: Proper migration support

### 6. Notification System ✅
- **EnergyReminderWorker.kt**: WorkManager-based notification system
- **Daily reminders**: Checks energy levels and sends notifications if low
- **Background processing**: Runs independently of the app
- **Notification channels**: Proper Android notification channel setup

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Fragment-based**: HomeFragment.kt as the main container
- **MVVM Pattern**: Uses Android Architecture Components
- **Coroutines**: Async operations with Kotlin Coroutines
- **LiveData/Flow**: Reactive data updates

### Key Components
1. **HomeFragment.kt** - Main fragment coordinating all functionality
2. **EnergyBatteryView.kt** - Custom view for battery display
3. **ActivityAdapter.kt** - RecyclerView adapter for activities
4. **AddActivityDialog.kt** - Dialog for activity management
5. **EnergyReminderWorker.kt** - Background notification service

### Database Schema
- **activities table**: Stores activity data (name, type, energy, people, mood, notes, date)
- **energy_logs table**: Tracks energy level changes over time

### Dependencies Added
- Material Design Components for chips and FAB
- WorkManager for background notifications
- Room database components
- Lottie animations for battery display

## Usage

### Adding Activities
1. Tap the "+" FAB button in the activities section
2. Fill in activity details (name, type, energy impact, people, mood, notes)
3. Activity is saved and energy level is updated accordingly

### Editing Activities
1. Tap on any activity in the list
2. Modify the details in the dialog
3. Changes are saved and energy level is adjusted

### Deleting Activities
1. Long-press on any activity in the list
2. Confirm deletion
3. Activity is removed and energy impact is reversed

### Mood Tracking
1. Select current mood from the chip group
2. Mood is logged with timestamp
3. Only one mood can be selected at a time

### Energy Management
- **Add Energy**: Tap "+" button to increase energy by 5
- **Remove Energy**: Tap "-" button to decrease energy by 5
- **Auto-update**: Energy changes automatically when activities are added/removed

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: ModelTest.kt for model validation
- **Integration Tests**: HomeFunctionalityTest.kt for database operations
- **UI Tests**: Comprehensive testing of all user interactions

## Future Enhancements
- Weekly survey implementation
- Cloud sync with Firebase
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Customizable notification frequency
- Energy level predictions based on activity patterns
